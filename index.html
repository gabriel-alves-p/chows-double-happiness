            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
                Chowâ€™s Double Happiness Chilli Oil is an old family recipe that has been passed down through two
                generations. My great grandfather immigrated to Canada from China when he was a young man; where he
                became a resident cook for a family in Toronto. He was passionate to try new things and experiment with
                food; this lead him to invent his own recipe for chilli oil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever I would go to Toronto to see my mothers side of the family; my grandfather Ken Chow would
                always cook dishes that his father would cook for him when he was younger.
                Every dish accompanied or had the chilli oil on it which enhanced the dishes with a bit of heat and
                extra flavour. We are now producing this recipe in the UK and are stocked in shops around England.
            </p>
